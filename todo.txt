To Do file for seddiff
----------------------

 * Use original filenames in the diff output
   - that is, somehow strip the '.tmp' extension from each filename
    in file header portion of the diff output
 * put temp files somewhere besides the local directory
   - the user may not have read/write privileges in the current dir
 * fix error when the same file is passed to seddiff:
   - seddiff -t dmesg file1 file1
